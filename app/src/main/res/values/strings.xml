        \n\n7. A "sucking" chest wound allows air to enter the person\'s chest cavity with each breath. This can cause a collapsed lung. Bandage the wound with plastic wrap, a plastic bag, or gauze pads covered with petroleum jelly, sealing it except for one corner. This allows trapped air to escape from the chest, but it prevents air from entering the chest through the wound.

    </string>
    <string name="health_emergency_B_03">
        1. Always Stay With the Person Until the Seizure Is Over
        \n\n\t\tSeizures can be unpredictable and it’s hard to tell how long they may last or what will occur during them. Some may start with minor symptoms, but lead to a loss of consciousness or fall. Other seizures may be brief and end in seconds.
        \n\n\t\tInjury can occur during or after a seizure, requiring help from other people.
        \n\n2. Pay attention to the length of the seizure
        \n\n\t\tLook at your watch and time the seizure – from beginning to the end of the active seizure.
        \n\n\t\tTime how long it takes for the person to recover and return to their usual activity.
        \n\n\t\tIf the active seizure lasts longer than the person’s typical events, call for help.
        \n\n\t\tKnow when to give \'as needed\' or rescue treatments, if prescribed, and when to call for emergency help.
        \n\n3. Stay calm; most seizures only last a few minutes
        \n\n\t\tA person’s response to seizures can affect how other people act. If the first person remains calm, it will help others stay calm too.
        \n\n\t\tTalk calmly and reassuringly to the person during and after the seizure – it will help as they recover from the seizure.
        \n\n4. Prevent injury by moving nearby objects out of the way
        \n\n\t\tRemove sharp objects.
        \n\n\t\tIf you can\’t move surrounding objects or a person is wandering or confused, help steer them clear of dangerous situations, for example away from traffic, train or subway platforms, heights, or sharp objects.
        \n\n5. Make the person as comfortable as possible
        \n\n\t\tHelp them sit down in a safe place.
        \n\n\t\tIf they are at risk of falling, call for help and lay them down on the floor.
        \n\n\t\tSupport the person\’s head to prevent it from hitting the floor.
        \n\n6. Keep onlookers away
        \n\n\t\tOnce the situation is under control, encourage people to step back and give the person some room. Waking up to a crowd can be embarrassing and confusing for a person after a seizure.
        \n\n\t\tAsk someone to stay nearby in case further help is needed.
        \n\n7. Do not forcibly hold the person down
        \n\n\t\tTrying to stop movements or forcibly holding a person down doesn\’t stop a seizure. Restraining a person can lead to injuries and make the person more confused, agitated or aggressive. People don\’t fight on purpose during a seizure. Yet if they are restrained when they are confused, they may respond aggressively.
        \n\n\t\tIf a person tries to walk around, let them walk in a safe, enclosed area if possible.
        \n\n8. Do not put anything in the person\'s mouth!
        \n\n\t\tJaw and face muscles may tighten during a seizure, causing the person to bite down. If this happens when something is in the mouth, the person may break and swallow the object or break their teeth!
        \n\n\t\tDon’t worry - a person can’t swallow their tongue during a seizure.
        \n\n9. Make sure their breathing is okay
        \n\n\t\tIf the person is lying down, turn them on their side, with their mouth pointing to the ground. This prevents saliva from blocking their airway and helps the person breathe more easily.
        \n\n\t\tDuring a convulsive or tonic-clonic seizure, it may look like the person has stopped breathing. This happens when the chest muscles tighten during the tonic phase of a seizure. As this part of a seizure ends, the muscles will relax and breathing will resume normally.
        \n\n\t\tRescue breathing or CPR is generally not needed during these seizure-induced changes in a person\’s breathing.
        \n\n10. Do not give water, pills, or food by mouth unless the person is fully alert
        \n\n\t\tIf a person is not fully awake or aware of what is going on, they might not swallow correctly.  Food, liquid or pills could go into the lungs instead of the stomach if they try to drink or eat at this time.
        \n\n\t\tIf a person appears to be choking, turn them on their side and call for help. If they are not able to cough and clear their air passages on their own or are having breathing difficulties, call 911 immediately.
        \n\n11. Call for emergency medical help when:
        \n\n\t\tA seizure lasts 5 minutes or longer.
        \n\n\t\tOne seizure occurs right after another without the person regaining consciousness or coming to between seizures.
        \n\n\t\tSeizures occur closer together than usual for that person.
        \n\n\t\tBreathing becomes difficult or the person appears to be choking.
        \n\n\t\tThe seizure occurs in water.
        \n\n\t\tInjury may have occurred.
        \n\n\t\tThe person asks for medical help.
        \n\n12. Be sensitive and supportive, and ask others to do the same
        \n\n\t\tSeizures can be frightening for the person having one, as well as for others. People may feel embarrassed or confused about what happened. Keep this in mind as the person wakes up.
        \n\n\t\tReassure the person that they are safe.
        \n\n\t\tOnce they are alert and able to communicate, tell them what happened in very simple terms.
        \n\n\t\tOffer to stay with the person until they are ready to go back to normal activity or call someone to stay with them.

        \n\n4. Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed.
        \n\n\t\tIf you think you\'re having a heart attack and your doctor has previously prescribed nitroglycerin for you, take it as directed.
        \n\n\t\tDon\'t take anyone else\'s nitroglycerin, because that could put you in more danger.
        \n\n5. Begin CPR if the person is unconscious.
        \n\n\t\tIf you\'re with a person who is unconscious, tell the 911 dispatcher or another emergency medical specialist. You may be advised to begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
        \n\n\t\tIf you haven\'t received CPR training, doctors recommend performing only chest compressions (about 100 to 120 compressions a minute). The dispatcher can instruct you in the proper procedures until help arrives.
        \n\n6. If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available, use it according to its instructions.

        \n\n2. Stay with your loved one.
        \n\n3. Don’t drive yourself or someone having the stroke to the hospital.
		\n\n4. Take note of the time the stroke took place and its duration.
        \n\n5. Do not offer the person food or medicine.

    <string name="health_emergency_B_05">
        1. Know all stroke symptoms.
        \n\n\t\tStrokes can carry a number of sudden, telltale symptoms, Dr. Mullen says. These include: A droop on 1 side of the face, Difficulty lifting 1 arm to its full height, Slurred speech or difficulty with talking, Impaired vision in 1 or both eyes, Vertigo, Difficulty walking
        \n\n2. Call 911.
        \n\n\t\t“Don\’t waste time by calling a family member, a friend, or the person\'s doctor," urges Daniel Labovitz, MD, an assistant professor of neurology at the Albert Einstein University College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center in New York. It\'s important to get stroke help immediately to increase the chances of a full recovery. "Call 911. It\'s okay if it turns out that the symptoms are not from stroke," he says.
        \n\n3. Stay with your loved one.
        \n\n\t\t When offering stroke help, you need to make sure that no additional harm comes to the stroke victim. "Stay with the patient to prevent them from falling or further injuring themselves," says Vibbert.
        \n\n4. Do Not Let that person go to sleep or talk you out of calling 911
		\n\n\t\t Stroke survivors often complain of suddenly feeling very sleepy when a stroke first happens.
		\n\n\t\t “A lot of patients come in and say they went to sleep for a few hours before they came to the hospital because they were tired,” Jean notes.
		\n\n\t\t But time is of the essence. “The medication we can give a stroke survivor is time sensitive,” she adds. “They should not go to sleep, and they should not call their primary care doctor 2 days from now. Instead, they should just go immediately to the emergency room.”
		\n\n\t\t And no matter how much someone might try to talk you out of taking them to the hospital, don’t let them, says Jean.
		\n\n5. Take a few notes.
        \n\n\t\tMake note of the time when the stroke took place. "This is critically important information later," says Vibbert. If the patient takes any medication, make a list of which ones (including dosage if you know it), and bring it to the hospital, he adds. If possible, bring the actual medications to the hospital with you.
        \n\n6. Do not drive yourself or someone to the hospital.
		\n\n\t\t It might seem like a good idea to drive a stroke victim to the nearest emergency room. But Jean says, “If someone is severely affected by a stroke, then you’re better off calling 911.”
		\n\n\t\t Emergency responders can start life-saving treatment for that person on the way to the emergency room, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says.
		\n\n\t\t You also don\’t want to drive yourself to a hospital in the event that your stroke symptoms worsen and impair your ability to drive safely.
		\n\n7. Do not offer the person food or medicine.
        \n\n\t\t"Although most strokes are caused by blockage in an artery, some strokes are caused by bleeding from an artery that burst," says Dr. Labovitz. "Giving aspirin to someone with this condition could make it worse."
        \n\n8. Stay calm.
        \n\n\t\tAlthough it can be difficult, it\'s important to compose yourself and assure the stroke victim that everything is going to be all right. "Try to concentrate on the situation and remind yourself that you are doing everything you can to help," says Danielle Haskins, MD, medical director of the Stroke Center at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. "Reassure your loved one that you aren\'t going anywhere and that help is on the way."
        \n\n9. Keep a positive outlook.
        \n\n\t\t"When they get the help they need, most patients improve enough to return home and function independently, even if they have some permanent symptoms," says Labovitz.
